What is Mean Stack JS?
-----------------

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - based framework. -AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop
- [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) - Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, we recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/meanstackjs.git

# Change directory
cd meanstackjs

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Start up the server
npm start
# or
node index.js
# or
nodemon index.js
```

**Note:** We highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node index.js` use `nodemon index.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.
